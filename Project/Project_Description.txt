Term Project
-------------
As a term project, you will build Regression and Classification Models.

For Regression model, you must implement the following algorithms.
1. Linear Regression
2. Polynomial Regression 
3. Lasso Regression
4. Ridge Regression
5. Elasticnet Regression

For Classification model, you must implement the following algorithms.
1. Logistic Regression with Regularization
2. Linear SVC (Support Vector Classifier) 

You have to also compare their performances through appropriate evaluation metrics. 

At the end, you need to write a report based on the given template and need to present your work (15 minutes presentation).
During the presentation, your cam must be switched on and each member in a group must participate in the presentation.
Not participating/attending presentation would incur serious penalty.

The date and time of the presentation will be notified in due course.
